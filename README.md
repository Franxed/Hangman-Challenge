This is a simple Python implementation of the classic Hangman game. The game selects a random word from a predefined list, and the player must guess the word one letter at a time. The player is shown underscores for each letter of the word, and correctly guessed letters are revealed in their respective positions.

The player has a limited number of incorrect guesses before the game ends. If the player successfully guesses all the letters of the word before exceeding the guess limit, they win the game.
